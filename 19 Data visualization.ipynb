    " - There are 23 possible customer locations in the continental US.\n",
    " - There are two tiers of 3D printers, tier 1 and tier 2.\n",
    " - It is possible to place between 0 and 30 printers at any given location.\n",

    " - There is a uniform one-time charge to purchase tier 1 or tier 2 printers. These were determined based on market research.  \n",
    " - There is a one-time start-up cost if any 3D printers are introduced at a particular location. \n",
    " - 3D printers have a maximum capacity to print parts, and can only print parts corresponding to their respective tier.\n",
    " - The distance between possible printer locations are based on the straight line distance between their latitudes and longitudes.\n",
